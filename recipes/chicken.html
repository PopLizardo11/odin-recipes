        <h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingred-list">
            <li> 1(3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
            <li> salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste</li>
            <li> 1/2 cup margarine, divided</li>
            <li> 1 stalk celery, leaves removed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="steps"> Steps </h2>
        <ol class="step-list">
            <li> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li> <br>
            <li>Place chicken in a roasting pan, and season generously 
                inside and out with salt and pepper. Sprinkle inside and 
                out with onion powder. Place 3 tablespoons margarine in the chicken cavity. 
                Arrange dollops of the remaining margarine around the chicken's exterior. 
                Cut the celery into 3 or 4 pieces, and place in the chicken cavity. </li> <br>
            <li> Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone 
                and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. An instant-read 
                thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, 
                should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove from heat and baste 
                with melted margarine and drippings. 
                Cover with aluminum foil and allow to rest about 
                30 minutes before serving.</li>
